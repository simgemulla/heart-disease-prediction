# Heart Disease Prediction

In this project, based on the data and the features we will predict that if people have heart disease or have not. We will use a small dataset that contains 303 rows. The feature will be 14 with the target data. 

We will use Logistic Regression first, than we will use XGBoost to compare the results.
